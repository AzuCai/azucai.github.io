                <li><a herf="https://github.com/AzuCai/ML-Toruial" target="_blank">ML-Toruial</a>: This repository contains a collection of Python-based implementations of classic machine learning algorithms, created by me during my time as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for a Machine Learning course. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide hands-on learning material for students and enthusiasts to understand the inner workings of these algorithms through clear, handwritten code. Each algorithm is implemented from scratch (without relying on pre-built libraries like scikit-learn for the core logic), applied to real-world datasets, and includes visualization or evaluation of results.</br>This project is designed for educational use, offering a practical way to explore machine learning concepts, from supervised and unsupervised learning to ensemble methods. </li>
